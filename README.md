# ryandolan123's admin commands

Long since abandoned, this was a set of Roblox admin commands that had advantages for the time in flexibility, programmability, and unmatchable security, whether used in your place or on a script builder.

This hasn't been updated in many years, and won't be. It is here solely for archive purposes. Many commands are broken. 

I'm rehosting this because, line-for-line, this is the 2nd largest project I've ever created in my life, second only to ModernDeck. While this probably won't be useful to literally anyone, I figure I could still make it public.
